Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of a hierarchical classification of classes. Let's delve into inheritance and its types:

Inheritance in Java:
Superclass (Base Class):

The class whose features are inherited is known as the superclass or base class.
It defines common attributes and methods that are shared by all subclasses.
Subclass (Derived Class):

The class that inherits features from another class is known as the subclass or derived class.
It extends the functionality of the superclass by adding new attributes or methods, or by overriding existing methods.

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Level Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces)
