🧠 Brainstorm-Lab — A Playground of Work-in-Progress and Learning by Doing
Brainstorm-Lab is a curated collection of personal projects that represent the raw, unpolished side of building and experimenting. These repositories may not be production-ready or fully documented — and that's intentional.

This lab is a sandbox for exploration, a reflection of the "learning by doing" philosophy. It houses early experiments, side projects, proof-of-concepts, and ideas-in-progress — all under one roof for easier organization and future iteration.

📚 Why This Exists
“Not everything has to be perfect to be meaningful.”

As a developer and researcher, I often build small tools, try out new technologies, or start ambitious ideas that don't always reach the finish line — but still teach me a lot. Instead of letting those projects remain scattered or forgotten, I’ve collected them here as a reference point, a learning trail, and a motivator to keep going.
